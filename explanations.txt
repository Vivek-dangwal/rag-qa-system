MANDATORY EXPLANATIONS - RAG QA SYSTEM
=====================================================

1. CHUNKING STRATEGY
--------------------
- Choice: 500 characters with a 50-character overlap.
- Reason: Technical hardware documents contain specific definitions. 500 characters 
  capture enough context (approx. 3-5 sentences) for the LLM to understand a 
  component. The 50-character overlap ensures that if a technical term or 
  sentence is cut off at the end of one chunk, it appears fully in the next, 
  preventing "context loss" during retrieval.

2. RETRIEVAL FAILURE CASE
-------------------------
- Observed Case: Querying for "Technical Specifications" (e.g., DPI, voltage, or 
  interface speeds).
- Observation: The FAISS vector store successfully retrieved chunks about 
  "Input Devices," but since the PDF (1.2 Hardware Overview) only listed names, 
  the LLM correctly stated it could not find technical details.
- Analysis: This is a "Content-Gap" failure. It proves the system is properly 
  "Grounded"—it refuses to make up (hallucinate) data that isn't in the 
  provided text.

3. METRIC TRACKED
-----------------
- Metric: sources_used (Retrieval Count / Top-K).
- Justification: I tracked the number of retrieved chunks sent to the LLM. 
  By setting K=3, the system balance precision and speed. It provides enough 
  diversity for the LLM to confirm a fact (or its absence) without 
  cluttering the prompt with irrelevant noise or increasing API latency.
